   Amend the rule titled "Assets" by, after the paragraph that starts with
   "An asset generally CAN be transferred", adding:
   
       When a rule indicates transfering an amount that is not a natural
       number, the specified amount is rounded up to the nearest natural
       number.
   
   And by, after the paragraph that starts "The "x balance of an entity"",
   adding:
   
       When a player causes one or more balances to change, e is ENCOURAGED
       to specify the resulting balance(s). Players SHOULD NOT specify

       Condition. For each time a player meets a Reward Condition, e MAY
       claim the specified award exactly once within 24 hours of meeting the
       Reward Condition.
   
       When a player 'claims' a Reward, Agora transfers the specified number
       of shinies to the player.
   
       Below is an exhaustive list of Reward Conditions and eir rewards:
   
          * The following two only apply to proposals that were pended via

             Floating Value.
   
             - Being the pender of an adopted proposal: 1/40th the current
             Floating Value.

          * Resolving an Agoran Decision for the first time this week: 5
          shinies.
   
   Enact a Power 1 rule titled "Floating Value" with the following text:
   
       Floating Value is a natural switch. When e publishes eir Weekly
       Report, the Secretary SHALL flip the Floating Value to Agora's shiny
       balance.
   
   Set every players's shiny balance to 0.
   
   Set Agora's shiny balance to 1000.
   
   Set the Floating Value to 200.

       Stamps are an asset, identified by eir creator and tracked by the
       Secretary.
   
       The Stamp Value is always 1/5th the current Floating Value.
   
       Once per month, a player MAY, by announcement, transfer to Agora the
       Stamp Value, in shinies, to create a Stamp.
   
       Players MAY, by announcement, destroy a Stamp and cause Agora to
       transfer the Stamp Value, in shinies, to em.

       destroy 10 stamps made by 10 different players by announcement to win
       the game.
   
   Enact a Power 1 rule titled "Welcome Packages" with the following text:

       to em.
   
   Enact a Power 1 rule titled "Action Points" with the following text:
   
       At the beginning of every Agoran Week, every player has 2 Action
       Points. When a player 'spends' an Action Point, e has one less
       Action Point. If a player has 0 Action Points, e may not spend any
       more Action Points, rules to the contrary notwithstanding.
   
   Amend R2445 "How to Pend a Proposal" to read, in full:
   
       Imminence is a switch, tracked by the Promotor, possessed by
       proposals in the Proposal Pool, whose value is either "pending" or
       "not pending" (default).
   
       Any player CAN flip a specified proposal's imminence to "pending" by
       announcement by:
   
          a) spending 1 Action Point, OR
   
          b) spending 1/20th the Floating Value in shinies.
   
   Amend R991 "Calls for Judgment" by replacing the first paragaraph with
   the following:
   
       Any person (the initiator) can initiate a Call for Judgement (CFJ,
       syn. Judicial Case), specifying a statement to be inquired into:
   
          a) by announcement, and spending 1 Action Point, OR
   
          b) by announcement, and spending 1/20th the Floating Value in
          shinies, OR

       When a person initiates a Call for Judgment, e may optionally bar one
       person from the case.
